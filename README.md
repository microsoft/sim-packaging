# Sim Packaging
Tooling to abstract away docker building of simulators that cannot be zip file dropped into the Bonsai Service as the status quo. It is a CLI tool which prompts for simulator dependencies, OS requirements, authenticates with ACR, builds, and pushes for you.

>ðŸš© Disclaimer: This is not an official Microsoft product. This application is considered an experimental addition to Microsoft Project Bonsai's software toolchain. It's primary goal is to reduce barriers of entry to use Project Bonsai's core Machine Teaching. Pull requests for fixes and small enhancements are welcome, but we do expect this to be replaced by out-of-the-box features of Project Bonsai in the near future.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Azure command line tools
- Azure permissions to ACR
- amd64 based host
- simulator that can reset, step using the following languages:
    - Python
    - Java
    - C#

## Installation
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Running
If one is unsure how to use the application, be sure to use the help flag.
```bash
sim-pack --help
```

### 1. Azure login
Make sure you have an active Azure login session.
(Note that this only needs to be run periodically).

```bash
az login
```

### 2. ACR Login
Make sure you have an active login credential to the ACR created by your managed resource from the Bonsai workspace. 
(Note that this only needs to be run periodically)

```bash
az acr login -n <ACR_NAME>
```

### 3. Create a requirements.txt
Create a file with dependencies for the simulator. For python, select pypi pinned versions like the following:

```javascript
numpy==1.16.4
matplotlib==3.0.3
pandas==0.25.1
scipy==1.3.0
microsoft-bonsai-api==0.1.2
bonsai-cli==1.0.1
```

### 4. Run the Script

Run `sim-pack <LANGUAGE_API>` where the `<LANGUAGE_API>` mode can consist of:
- python_api
- java_api
- C#_api

> Note: Only the python path is functional.

For example, the python route will look like the following.

```bash
sim-pack python_api
```

The application will prompt you for responses, an example may look like the following.

```bash
Is windows or linux required to run Simulator?: windows
Directory of Simulator integration files: sample/
What is the name of the file with microsoft bonsai api? (e.g., main.py): main.py
Directory of requirements.txt: .
Image Name (No underscores): my-first-sim
Name of the ACR (without azurecr.io): mydemo
```

### Optional flags

If one desires to specify their base image for complex scenarios, use the `--base-img` flag and enter a string of the base image. This may be helpful in scenarios where the simulator is dependent on another base image other than the following: `python:3.7.4`for Linux and `mcr.microsoft.com/windows:10.0.17763.1040` for Windows. This can also be particularly useful when a base image is used with previously installed dependencies. When using a base image that cannot be downloadable without credentials, be sure the base image exists in the desired ACR.

```bash
sim-pack python_api --base-img <BASE_IMG>
```

>Example: sim-pack python_api --base-img mydemo.azurecr.io/sample-base:latest
